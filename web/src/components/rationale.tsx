            Early medical illustrators built careers by drawing for textbooks. It is now <strong>2025</strong>. There are only so many textbooks to draw but <strong>hundreds of new medical illustrators graduate each year</strong>.

            However, U.S. biotech investment has <strong>exploded</strong> - from about <strong>$15 billion in 2014</strong> to over <strong>$160 billion in 2024</strong>. Last year alone, more than <strong>700 early-stage biotechs and med-device companies</strong> raised new funding in the U.S. Nearly all of them need to communicate their science - <em>mechanisms of action, devices, data</em> - but <strong>few have in-house artists</strong>. <strong>They contract that work out</strong>. The problem? <strong>They can't find you</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why can't they find you? You likely have <strong>Behance, Instagram, and your own site on Squarespace</strong>. But if a biotech marketer Googles <em>"3D device animator"</em> you'll never show. <strong>Each artist is an island</strong>. All business funnels to the same <strong>10 agencies</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of this platform is to <strong>level the playing field</strong>. If enough artists join, Google will be <strong>wayyy</strong> more likely to show you to the right people and get you business.
