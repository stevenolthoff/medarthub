            Early medical illustrators built careers by drawing for textbooks. It is now 2025. There are only so many textbooks to draw but hundreds of new medical illustrators graduate each year.

            But there is still plenty of work! US biotech investment alone has grown from X in YEAR to Y in YEAR. Countless companies need to show their mechanisms of action, devices, and more. They need you. The problem? They can't find you.

            Why can't they find you? You likely have Behance, Instagram, and your own site on Squarespace. But if a biotech marketer Googles "3D device animator" you'll never show. Each artist is an island. All business funnels to the same 10 big players.

            The aim of this platform is to level the playing field. If enough artists join, Google will be <strong>wayyy</strong> more likely to show you to the right people.
