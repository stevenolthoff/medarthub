NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly says "commit". Do not commit automatically, even after completing work.

When the user says "commit":
1. Use `git add -A` to stage all changes
2. Use `git commit -m "descriptive message"` with a one-liner but descriptive commit message that clearly explains what was done

The commit message should be:
- One line only
- Concise but descriptive
- Focused on what was accomplished
- Use imperative mood when appropriate (e.g., "Add profile picture field to artist table" not "Added profile picture field")

Example good messages:
- "Add profile picture field to artist table"
- "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens"
- "Fix image upload validation bug"
- "Add responsive layout for mobile devices"
